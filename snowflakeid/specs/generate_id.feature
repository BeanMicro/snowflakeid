Feature: A new distributed ID can be generated
  Snowflakes are 64 bits in binary.
  (Only 63 are used to fit in a signed integer.)
  The first 41 bits are a timestamp, representing milliseconds since the chosen epoch.
  The next 10 bits represent a machine ID, preventing clashes.
  Twelve more bits represent a per-machine sequence number,
  to allow creation of multiple snowflakes in the same millisecond.
  The final number is generally serialized in decimal.

  Rule: When a snowflake id is generated without epoch,
    it should be defaulted to 1759536000000
    And the sequence number should be incremented.

    Scenario Outline: Validating the calculation of timestamp and
    generation of the per-machine sequence number
      Given today is <datetime> UTC
      And machineId is "<machineId>"
      And previous sequence number is <previousSequenceNumber>
      When a new distributed ID is generated
      Then it should be "<newDistributedId>"
      And the new sequence number should be <newSequenceNumber>

      Examples:
        | datetime                | machineId | previousSequenceNumber | newDistributedId    | newSequenceNumber |
        | 2025-04-10T00:00:00     | 123       | NULL                   | 503808              | 0                 |
        | 2037-05-28T14:24:45.448 | 378       | NULL                   | 1541815603606036480 | 0                 |
        | 2037-05-28T14:24:45.448 | 378       | 0                      | 1541815603606036481 | 1                 |
        | 2037-05-28T14:24:45.448 | 378       | 1                      | 1541815603606036482 | 2                 |
